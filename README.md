# C-Temperature-Project
The goal of this project was to build a loop that would never stop. The software will ask the user to input his or her name, then ask if they want to use Fahrenheit or Celsius, and finally convert the selected temperature to another. If a person selects Fahrenheit and enters a temperature in Fahrenheit, the code will automatically convert it too Celsius. People's life is made simpler since they now have a machine that converts for them. 
  

I approached the assignment systematically, which means I used what I'd learned in class and arithmetic to come up with a solution to construct this application. handled it in this manner because it helped me to see and grasp it more logically. I started with the IPO chart and then moved on to the code. I started with the IPO chart since it helps you comprehend the program and what is required for the code. The difficulties I had during the development phase for this project were when I was coding it and trying to get the code to work. It took me a few days to find out the mistakes I made in the project. Honestly next time I think I should start it a week before I started doing everything last minute which caused me to be in rush and cause some issues while doing it.
